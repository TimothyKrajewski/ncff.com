    Hello there everyone,<br> <br>
&emsp;&emsp;My name is Madeline Tallman, for those of you who do not know me I have been a life-long resident of Neptune city and in my opinion there is no town better! My family has lived in Neptune City for the past 60 years. I went to Woodrow Wilson elementary school and I truly enjoyed my experience there. I feel that Wilson school played a major role in shaping who I am today. I have amazing memories from my time at Wilson school such as different class trips I attended while enrolled in the school as well as different school functions I went to and different extracurricular activities I was a part of. Some of the experiences I had at Woodrow Wilson helped get me to where I am today, that being said you can find out much more about where I am today by reading my bio on the Neptune City Family Foundation Website page-<br> 
&emsp;&emsp;Neptune City is such a special town to me because it is where I have lived since I was about a year old. My family however have been residents of Neptune City for about 60 years. My grandmother moved here with my Grandmother in the late 1950’s and my dad and uncles were all born and raised here and each attended Woodrow Wilson elementary school. One of the things I love the most about Neptune City as a town is the fact that we truly are more than just a community we really are a family and I think one of the strongest ties within our family were made from being a part of the Woodrow Wilson family. I remember making my first true friendships within Neptune City at Wilson school. I remember my parents becoming involved with different events and organizations within the town. There is something about our little town that I cannot truly explain or define but there is something that sets it apart from all the rest, there is something that makes the town a family and I believe that all this starts with the school. <br>
&emsp;&emsp;I began school at Woodrow Wilson elementary school when I was in kindergarten as the years went on I made such strong friendships with many of my classmates and my family became friends with my peer’s families. One thing I love the most about the town of Neptune City is our unique little elementary school. I greatly enjoyed my time at Woodrow Wilson elementary school and I really would not have traded it for the world. Having such a small school really benefited me because I truly felt that throughout my years there all of the teachers and administration knew me on a very personal level. Having such a personal contact with my teachers and the administration really made me feel as though they all genuinely had my best interest at heart which made going to school and learning much more meaningful. <br> 
&emsp;&emsp;Neptune City elementary school gave me some wonderful years and I want the school to be able to continue to give students a wonderful experience just like the one I had, for this reason my brother and I have decided to start this foundation. My brother and I are both alumni of the Neptune City elementary school and we both had overall a wonderful experience at the school. With this being said we are saddened by the current situation that the school is in and would like nothing more than to help get the school we know and love back on track! We started the Neptune City Family Foundation as a foundation to help provide the Neptune City elementary school students with the resources they need to go on to achieve a bright and successful future! However, our foundation is much different than your ordinary foundation you see we would like to achieve our goal with the help of our entire community! We are not asking for everyone to donate money we will be accepting donations of your time as well. What I mean by this is that yes we will always be accepting donations of money but we are also more than happy to have you volunteer your time at any of our events. My brother and I have started the donations by donating $1000 to the school. We want nothing more than for Woodrow Wilson Elementary school to be the wonderful, amazing small town school that it has always been. <br> 
&emsp;&emsp;As I have stated I have a true love for the town of Neptune City as does my family. We want this town to prosper, grow, and evolve and this all starts with our school. Woodrow Wilson elementary school has not only given my family wonderful memories but it has given thousands of people who live in or out of our town the same wonderful memories as well. Neptune City is really a one of a kind town and Woodrow Wilson is a really one of a kind school. We would love your help in any way shape or form to help us ensure the success of all the students of Neptune city elementary school. Donate today! <br> 
<br>
Sincerely,<br> 
Madeline Tallman <br>
