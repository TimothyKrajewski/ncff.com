    <p> 
    My name is Madeline Tallman I am currently a student at The College of New Jersey! I am a Secondary Education and History double major! I have lived in Neptune city my entire life and want nothing more than the town to grow and prosper. I believe Woodrow Wilson Elementary school is a fundamental part of the town of Neptune City. I myself am a graduate of Neptune City elementary school and I enjoyed each and every moment of my time there. My goal as president of this foundation is to help fund Neptune City school so that each student can get the resources they need to achieve success! I hope that you will join me in accomplishing this goal!

    <h2><b>Alex Tallman</b></h2>
      <p> 
    Alex Tallman currently serves as a Councilman in the Borough of Neptune City, while also working for L’Oreal, and studying full time as an undergraduate student. Alex is a Harvard, and Wilson School alumni, having graduated from Wilson School in 2009, and Harvard in 2017.  Alex and Madeline first came up with the idea for the Neptune City Family Foundation while Alex was campaigning for his first term on Town Council. In speaking with the residents of Neptune City, Alex and Madeline noticed that an issue people consistently expressed concern with was the school. Determined to find a way to help, the two siblings realized that through starting a foundation they might be able to create a positive impact for the children of their hometown. Today, Alex has donated over $1,000 to the Neptune City Family Foundation, and works actively to try and garner more funding to help our students!
